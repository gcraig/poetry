Mixed Up Paul

"My name, good sir, is Revere,
And this landscape, divinely, quite queer."

"Might I bother you for directions?
Then again, I'm surely lost, upon reflection."

"I have an important message to send.
Hark, wake up, we must defend!"

"Oh ... if I had only listened to my wife,
Our fledgling colonies would have less strife."

"A pint or two would suffice,
Instead I made it ten thrice."

"Next time, it's in bed by eleven,
That is, if I'm not dead or shackled, thank Heaven."

"Sir, I bid you Adieu."
"Alas, those chaps on board were they dressed in red, not blue?"
