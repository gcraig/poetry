The Price

Shorn and shackled,
My will remained untackled.
Splattered and sprinkled,
My rags tattered and wrinkled.
The garbs on me stained crimson,
My heart raced like a piston.
Led to the gallows, fightin' and a fistin',
I was going out tougher than Sonny Liston.
No governor would call,
I was forced to face it all.
The sharp burning pain, surely near,
I was prepared to accept my fear.
The smell of death was nigh,
For the State would have it's high.
Time moved like an elephant,
For the lurkers jeered my rant.
My beaten body would suffice,
For I've paid the ultimate price.
