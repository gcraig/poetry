Squirrels

Three squirrels in a tree,
how happy they must be.

Their frisky tails show me,
how joyous life can be.

Bound by nothing and free,
they spend their time with glee.

I wonder what's in store for me,
my problems don't seem to flee.

Still I hope that I can be,
as giddy as they appear to me.
