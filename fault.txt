Fault

The sharding of a limb.
Was it me or was it him?

Deliberate as it may seem,
do I appear guilty, will they deem?

To assert my fault unseen,
appalls the man I've been.

Yet surely this poor fellow,
no longer serene or mellow,

Will seek out fault,
force us all to hault,
to find the one obscene.
